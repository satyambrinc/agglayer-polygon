# Polygon AggLayer: Can It Connect All Chains?

## Cross-Chain Connectivity Status

### ‚úÖ **Currently Connected**
- **9 chains** - all Polygon CDK chains only
- **Rome Protocol** - enables Ethereum-Solana bridge

### üéØ **Planned Connections**
- Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos
- "All of Web3" - universal connectivity vision

### ‚ùå **Key Limitation**
**Only works with Polygon CDK chains currently**

## What Is AggLayer?

Polygon's protocol to unify all blockchains into one network using:
- ZK proofs for security
- Single bridge (no wrapped tokens)
- Sub-5 second cross-chain transfers (coming soon)

## The Vision vs Reality

**Vision**: *"Connect all of Web3 - not just L2s or L1s, but literally bringing it all together"* - Polygon CEO

**Reality**: Limited to 9 Polygon CDK chains with broader support in development

## Key Benefits
- One-click transactions between chains
- Shared liquidity across all connected networks  
- Native tokens (no wrapping)
- Maintained chain sovereignty

## Current Status
- **v0.3** live with security proofs
- **190+ projects** using Polygon CDK
- **$420M+ TVL** across connected chains
- **30 Fortune 500** companies deployed

## Main Challenges
- **Technical**: 12-minute Ethereum finality delays
- **Adoption**: Non-EVM chains need custom integration
- **Scope**: Currently CDK-only, not truly universal

## Bottom Line

**AggLayer aims for universal blockchain connectivity but is currently limited to Polygon's own ecosystem. The technology is promising, but connecting "all chains" remains aspirational rather than achieved.**

**Status: üü° Partial - Works within Polygon ecosystem, universal connectivity still in development**
